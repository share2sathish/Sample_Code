Number of operations taken:
---------------------------

	 Liner time O(n)
		- maximum number of guesses is the same as the size of the list
		Ex:
			100 element
			100 guess
	 logarthimic time O(log n)
		
		Ex:
			100 element
			7 guess
		
		log  100 = 7 ( because 2 ^ 7 = 128 )
		   2
		   
Big O:

	What is Big O ?
		This tells you the number of operations an algorithm will make. It's 
		called Big O notation because you put a “big O” in front of the number of operations
		
Common Big O run times:
-----------------------

	Simple search 			- O(n) 			- Liner time
	Binary search 			- O(log n) 		- log time
	Quick stort	  			- O(n* log n) 	- Fast sorting algorithm
	Selection sort 			- O(n2 ) 		- Slow sorting algorithm
	travelling sales person	- O(!n)			- Really slow algorithm
