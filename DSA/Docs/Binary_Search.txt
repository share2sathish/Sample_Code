Number of operations taken:

	 Liner time O(n)
		- maximum number of guesses is the same as the size of the list
		Ex:
			100 element
			100 guess
	 logarthimic time O(log n)
		
		Ex:
			100 element
			7 guess
		
		log  100 = 7 ( because 2 ^ 7 = 128 )
		   2
		   
Binary search:

	- Best to use when list of element in sorted order.
	- O(log n ) operations binary search can possibly make.
	  Ex: From one billon elemnets , If we want to find particular element	
		  It will 33 iteration to find that element.
