Binary search:

	- Best to use when list of element in sorted order.
	- O(log n ) operations binary search can possibly make.
	  Ex: From one billon elemnets , If we want to find particular element	
		  It will 33 iteration to find that element.
		  
Point to be noted:

	- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
	- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once 
	  the list of items youâ€™re searching through grows.
